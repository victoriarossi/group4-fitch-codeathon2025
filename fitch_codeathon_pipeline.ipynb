    "### What it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sector Revenue PCA**: \n",
    "   - Creates pivot table of revenue percentages by NACE sector codes\n",
    "   - Applies PCA to reduce dimensionality while preserving sector patterns\n",
    "   - Generates `Sector_Comp_1` through `Sector_Comp_10` features\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Environmental Activity Aggregations**:\n",
    "   - Counts number of activities per entity (`num_activities`)\n",
    "   - Computes average environmental score adjustment\n",
    "   - Creates binary indicator for activity presence\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interaction Features**:\n",
    "   - `revenue_x_environmental_score`: Captures company size effect on environmental impact\n",
    "   - `revenue_x_governance_score`: Size-governance relationship\n",
    "   - `E_x_S`, `S_x_G`: ESG component interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Country-Level Features**:\n",
    "   - `country_ts2_per_revenue`: Average Scope 2 emissions per revenue for each country\n",
    "   - Helps capture regional regulatory and infrastructure differences\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Log Transformations**:\n",
    "   - `target_scope_1_log` and `target_scope_2_log`\n",
    "   - Normalizes skewed target distributions for better model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA reduces hundreds of sector codes to 10 meaningful components\n",
    "- **Non-linear Patterns**: Interaction terms help models capture multiplicative relationships\n",
    "- **Geographic Context**: Country aggregations encode regional differences in emissions\n",
    "- **Better Model Performance**: Engineered features typically improve R² by 10-20% over raw features"

    "\n",
    "### The Problem:\n",
    "Our models were trained on **engineered features**, not raw data. The test.csv file only contains raw features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What process_test_data.py does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Merges supplementary datasets**: Joins environmental_activities, SDG, and revenue data to test entities\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recreates PCA components**: \n",
    "   - Uses training data to fit StandardScaler and PCA\n",
    "   - Transforms test revenue distribution into same `Sector_Comp_1-10` space\n",
    "   - Critical: Must use SAME scaler/PCA fitted on training data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generates aggregations**:\n",
    "   - Environmental activity counts and averages\n",
    "   - Sector-level statistics (from training data)\n",
    "   - Country-level statistics (from training data)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creates interaction features**:\n",
    "   - All multiplication/ratio features: `revenue_x_environmental_score`, `E_x_S`, etc.\n",
    "   - ESG PCA components using training data's PCA transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handles missing values**:\n",
    "   - Fills with training data medians to maintain consistency\n",
    "   - Ensures no NaN values that would break prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature alignment is crucial**:\n",
    "- Models expect EXACT same features in SAME order\n",
    "- PCA/scaling must use training parameters (not refit on test)\n",
    "- Aggregations must reference training statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without proper feature engineering**:\n",
    "- ❌ Model would see completely different feature space\n",
    "- ❌ Predictions would be meaningless or fail entirely\n",
    "- ❌ Feature names/counts wouldn't match\n",
    "\n",
    "**With proper feature engineering**:\n",
    "- ✓ Test data in same feature space as training\n",
    "- ✓ Models can make accurate predictions\n",
    "- ✓ Results are comparable and valid"
